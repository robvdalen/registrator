# Registrator

Service registry bridge for Docker.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PDOK/registrator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PDOK/registrator)
[![Docker pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/pdok/registrator.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pdok/registrator/)
<br /><br />

This version has Eureka support, see [backends](docs/user/backends.md)
NOTE: All other backends are removed due to compability issues with newer Go and dependency versions
<br />

Registrator automatically registers and deregisters services for any Docker
container by inspecting containers as they come online. Registrator
supports pluggable service registries, which currently includes
[Consul](http://www.consul.io/), [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and
[SkyDNS 2](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns/).

## Getting Registrator

	$ docker pull gliderlabs/registrator:latest

Latest tag always points to the latest release. There is also a `:master` tag
and version tags to pin to specific releases.
